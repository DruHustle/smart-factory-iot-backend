# Smart Factory IoT Backend

A robust, scalable .NET-based microservices backend designed for real-time industrial monitoring and control. This repository provides the core infrastructure and services to connect edge devices (ESP-32 Wrover) via an IoT gateway (Raspberry Pi 5) to the Azure cloud ecosystem.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Microservices Architecture**: Built with .NET 8, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and S.O.L.I.D. principles for high maintainability and scalability.
*   **IoT Integration**: Seamless connectivity with **Azure IoT Hub** for telemetry ingestion, device twin synchronization, and cloud-to-device (C2D) commands.
*   **Real-time Analytics**: Dedicated analytics engine for calculating **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** and detecting sensor anomalies (temperature, humidity, vibration).
*   **Edge-to-Cloud Connectivity**: Optimized for **Raspberry Pi 5** gateways and **ESP-32 Wrover** edge nodes using MQTT/AMQP protocols.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Fully automated resource provisioning using **Terraform** and **Azure Bicep**.
*   **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated via **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.
*   **Real-time Dashboards**: Integrated with **Azure SignalR Service** to push live telemetry updates to the frontend.
*   **Enterprise Security**: Secured with **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**, RBAC, and **Azure Key Vault** for secrets management.
