# Legacy Kubernetes references

The retained manifests describe an earlier deployment and are outside the supported six-service release. Kubernetes is unnecessary for the selected target. Do not use these manifests as the current production configuration.

If these references are adapted for a future Kubernetes rollout, run both digest-pinned jobs in `migrations/` before the matching DeviceService and TelemetryService workloads. Give each Job a release-specific name and do not start the telemetry worker unless the telemetry migration completes successfully.

Use the canonical [Vercel/Render and local guide](https://github.com/DruHustle/smart-factory-iot-frontend/blob/main/RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md).
